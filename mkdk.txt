MKDK-SETUP THE FULL OPERATING SYSTEM
This is a pretty small os. But it may not be full. To setup the full os follow these steps.

This is from the file setupfull.tem, so please read it for best results!
Type the command:

nano .bashrc
alias ll='ls -l'
alias la='ls -A'
alias l='ls -CF'

Then put this in next:


alias ardenmk='sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade; echo "ardenmk"'
alias mbi='nano .bashrc; alias ll='ls -l'; alias la='ls -A'; alias l='ls -CF'; echo "mbi"'
alias readme='echo -Basic-; echo This is ArdenWARE 1.0, this is a test image for ArdenWARE. The other test image can be installed with ver13.tem! All .tem files; echo are ran with terminal. Or run setupextra.tem for a full installion.; echo -Custom Commands (Full Installion Version Only)-; echo mbi- a base for making a custom command.; echo ardenmk- fully update system DO NOT USE TO UPDATE REGULARLY; echo readme- opens readme in terminal; echo system-cksum- performs a checksum on important files of the os'
alias system-cksum='cksum _service; cksum config.kiwi; cksum config.sh'

Or, if it lets you, put this in:

nano .bashrc
alias ll='ls -l'
alias la='ls -A'
alias l='ls -CF'
alias ardenmk='sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade; echo "ardenmk"'
alias mbi='nano .bashrc; alias ll='ls -l'; alias la='ls -A'; alias l='ls -CF'; echo "mbi"'
alias readme='echo -Basic-; echo This is ArdenWARE 1.0, this is a test image for ArdenWARE. The other test image can be installed with ver13.tem! All .tem files; echo are ran with terminal. Or run setupextra.tem for a full installion.; echo -Custom Commands (Full Installion Version Only)-; echo mbi- a base for making a custom command.; echo ardenmk- fully update system DO NOT USE TO UPDATE REGULARLY; echo readme- opens readme in terminal; echo system-cksum- performs a checksum on important files of the os'
alias system-cksum='cksum _service; cksum config.kiwi; cksum config.sh'

If that does not work, get a version of this os with the full os preinstalled. With ver14.tem!
